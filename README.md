## 🌍 Project Overview

Despite progress in recent years, over **33% of Rwandan children under 5** remain stunted.  
This project leverages national data and machine learning to:

- Identify **malnutrition hotspots**
- Model **key predictive risk factors**
- Simulate **household-level stunting risk**
- Recommend **evidence-based policy interventions**
- Provide a **dashboard** for government and NGO planning

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🗺️ Map stunting, wasting, and underweight rates across Rwanda
- 🤖 Train models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression) on CFSVA 2024 data
- 📍 Pinpoint top malnutrition predictors
- 🧠 Simulate stunting risk using household inputs
- 🧩 Recommend root-cause-based interventions
- 📊 Build a decision-support dashboard

## 📊 Key Findings

**Top 5 High-Stunting Districts:**

- Nyabihu, Rubavu, Rutsiro, Burera, Gakenke

**Top Predictive Risk Factors:**

- Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)
- Vitamin A intake
- Household Wealth Index
- Dietary Diversity (Women)
- WASH conditions (water source, handwashing)
- Illness history (diarrhea, fever)

| Feature               | Root Cause                  | Suggested Intervention                    |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Low MUAC             | Undernutrition              | Growth monitoring, feeding support        |
| No Vitamin A         | Micronutrient deficiency    | Supplementation campaigns                 |
| Low Wealth Index     | Poverty                     | Cash transfers, job creation programs     |
| Unsafe Water Source  | Infrastructure gaps         | Water access projects, WASH support       |
| Rare Handwashing     | Hygiene knowledge gap       | Community hygiene education               |
| Low Dietary Diversity| Food insecurity             | Kitchen gardens, local nutrition farming  |
