🇷🇼 Ending Hidden Hunger in Rwanda
Track 2 – Big Data Hackathon 2025

Team: UWERA Liliane
Language: Python
Deployment: Streamlit

🌍 Project Overview

Despite progress in recent years, over 33% of Rwandan children under 5 remain stunted.
This project leverages national data and machine learning to:

🗺️ Identify malnutrition hotspots

🧠 Model key predictive risk factors

🧮 Simulate household-level stunting risk

🧩 Recommend evidence-based policy interventions

💻 Provide a decision-support dashboard for government and NGO planning

🎯 Objectives

🗺️ Map stunting, wasting, and underweight rates across Rwanda

🤖 Train models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression) on CFSVA 2024 data

📍 Pinpoint top malnutrition predictors

🧠 Simulate stunting risk using household inputs

🧩 Recommend root-cause-based interventions

📊 Build a decision-support dashboard

📊 Key Findings

Top 5 High-Stunting Districts:
Nyabihu, Rubavu, Rutsiro, Burera, Gakenke

Top Predictive Risk Factors:

Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)

Vitamin A intake

Household Wealth Index

Dietary Diversity (Women)

WASH conditions (water source, handwashing)

Illness history (diarrhea, fever)

🧠 Root Cause Summary
Feature	Root Cause	Suggested Intervention
Low MUAC	Undernutrition	Growth monitoring, feeding support
No Vitamin A	Micronutrient deficiency	Supplementation campaigns
Low Wealth Index	Poverty	Cash transfers, job creation programs
Unsafe Water Source	Infrastructure gaps	Water access projects, WASH support
Rare Handwashing	Hygiene knowledge gap	Community hygiene education
Low Dietary Diversity	Food insecurity	Kitchen gardens, local nutrition farming
💻 Dashboard Features

The Streamlit dashboard includes the following interactive tabs:

🗺️ Geographic Insights – Choropleth maps by district & province

📈 Feature Importance – Model-driven risk factor analysis

🧠 Stunting Risk Simulator – Predict household stunting risk

🧩 Root Causes & Interventions – RCA and policy mapping

📈 Data Sources

This project uses the following publicly available dataset:

National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR).
Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA) 2024, Version 0.1 – Public Use Dataset.
Kigali, Rwanda: NISR, 2024.
Available from: https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw

License: Public Use Dataset — for research and policy analysis purposes.
Access: Free download from the NISR Microdata Portal.

🧩 Variables Used in Modeling
Category	Variables Used	Description
Child Health	MUAC (Mid-Upper Arm Circumference), Illness history (fever, diarrhea)	Indicators of child nutritional and health status
Dietary Factors	Vitamin A intake, Dietary diversity (children & women)	Measures micronutrient adequacy and diet variety
Socioeconomic Status	Household wealth index, Education level of caregiver	Reflects income, assets, and knowledge access
WASH Indicators	Drinking water source, Handwashing availability	Relates to hygiene and disease prevention
Household Demographics	Household size, Region (province/district)	Contextual and spatial determinants of malnutrition

⚠️ Variables directly implying stunting (e.g., height-for-age Z-scores) were excluded to prevent data leakage.

⚙️ Data Preprocessing Steps

Removed incomplete or duplicate records

Replaced “Unknown” location values with randomly assigned valid cells/villages

Standardized categorical and numerical values

Applied normalization to scale features between 0–1

Balanced the dataset using SMOTE and class weighting

🗺️ Geospatial Data

Used for mapping and visualization:

Rwanda district and province boundaries from GADM v4.1 shapefiles

Converted to GeoJSON format for integration in Streamlit maps
