# 🌍 **Ending Hidden Hunger in Rwanda**
### Track 2 – Big Data Hackathon 2025  
**Team:** UWERA Liliane  
**Language:** Python  
**Deployment:** Streamlit

---

## 📊 **Project Overview**

Despite progress in recent years, over 33% of Rwandan children under 5 remain stunted. This project leverages national data and machine learning to:

- 🗺️ **Identify malnutrition hotspots**
- 🧠 **Model key predictive risk factors**
- 🧮 **Simulate household-level stunting risk**
- 🧩 **Recommend evidence-based policy interventions**
- 💻 **Provide a decision-support dashboard for government and NGO planning**

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

1. **Map** stunting, wasting, and underweight rates across Rwanda
2. **Train models** (XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression) on CFSVA 2024 data
3. **Pinpoint** top malnutrition predictors
4. **Simulate** stunting risk using household inputs
5. **Recommend** root-cause-based interventions
6. **Build** a decision-support dashboard

## 📊 **Key Findings**

### **Top 5 High-Stunting Districts:**

1. Nyabihu
2. Rubavu
3. Rutsiro
4. Burera
5. Gakenke

### **Top Predictive Risk Factors:**

- Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)
- Vitamin A intake
- Household Wealth Index
- Dietary Diversity (Women)
- WASH conditions (water source, handwashing)
- Illness history (diarrhea, fever)

## 🧠 **Root Cause Summary**

| **Feature**               | **Root Cause**        | **Suggested Intervention**             |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Low MUAC                  | Undernutrition        | Growth monitoring, feeding support    |
| No Vitamin A              | Micronutrient deficiency | Supplementation campaigns            |
| Low Wealth Index          | Poverty               | Cash transfers, job creation programs |
| Unsafe Water Source       | Infrastructure gaps   | Water access projects, WASH support   |
| Rare Handwashing          | Hygiene knowledge gap | Community hygiene education           |
| Low Dietary Diversity     | Food insecurity       | Kitchen gardens, local nutrition farming |
